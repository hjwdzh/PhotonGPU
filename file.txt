1. sweet sunday: a real-time rendering framework

2. Modeling the Swan
	Model & Texture

3. framework (Fully GPU: CUDA + OpenGL)
	support point & direct light
	3D mesh(obj), texture, rotation
	GPU BVH
	Rendering path: 1 Diffuse, 2 refraction, 7 reflection
	Real-time Caustics from refraction and reflection
	Real-time subsurface scattering

4. Caustics
	images: dragon
			swan
			caustic map

	Method: 1. Project light to the receiver's texture image
			2. Render the caustics by blending receivers' caustics in a local area

5. Subsurface Scattering
	images: light view photon intensity
			subsurface scattering intensity
			final swan

	Method: 1. Store the direct photons in the light's view (photon and intersection points)
			2. Render the scattering effect by summing up the photons (stored in light's view) which are smaller than $r$ with the dipole model.
